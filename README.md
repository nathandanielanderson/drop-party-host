# Drop Party

This project is a **Next.js** TypeScript application designed to host a **Unity WebGL build** within a web environment. The goal is to create a seamless experience where users can interact with a 3D environment powered by Unity, directly embedded in the web app. This setup allows for integrating blockchain elements, specifically on the **Solana** network.

## Features to Implement

- **Unity WebGL Integration**: Embed a Unity WebGL build within the Next.js app, allowing users to interact with a 3D environment.
- **Solana Wallet Integration**: Connect a Solana wallet to enable users to log in and use blockchain-based assets.
- **SPL Token Interactivity**: Display, interact, and manage SPLs within the Unity environment, including options for players to drop and pick up tokens.
- **Real-Time Multiplayer**: Implement real-time multiplayer features using a server setup with **Mirror** in Unity, allowing users to see and interact with each other in the 3D space.
